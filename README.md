PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

A spam classifier is a machine learning model or algorithm designed to automatically detect and filter spam messages from legitimate ones. It analyzes the content and characteristics of incoming messages, such as emails or text 
messages, and assigns them a probability score of being spam or not. The classifier uses features like keywords, patterns, and sender information to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages, helping users manage their 
communications effectively and reduce the impact of spam in their daily interactions.

FEATURES : 
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess email text data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Use NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from email content.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to classify emails as phishing or legitimate.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using various metrics.
Deployment: Provide scripts and guidelines for deploying the phishing email filter.

USAGE :

1. Preprocess the data.
2. Train the model.
3. Evaluate the model.
4. Filter emails.

DATASET :

The project uses a dataset of emails labeled as phishing or legitimate. If you use an external dataset, ensure it is properly formatted and preprocessed.

MODEL :

The project employs various machine learning models, including:

Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Gaussian Naive Bayes,
XG Boost,
Bernoulli NB,
Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree,
Support Vector Classifier,
KNN,
Random Forest,
XGB,
XGBRF.

RESULTS:

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision. The results are summarized as follows:

Accuracy: 91%, 
Precision: 90%
